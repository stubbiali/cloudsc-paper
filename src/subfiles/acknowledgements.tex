	    This study was conducted as part of the project KILOS ("Kilometer-scale Non-hydrostatic global weather forecasting with IFS-FVM"), funded by the Platform for Advanced Scientific Computing (PASC), which equipped us with compute resources on the Piz Daint machine. We thankfully acknowledge EuroHPC for giving us access to the MeluXina supercomputer under the project ID 200177. This work was also supported by a grant from the Destination Earth program on the LUMI system under the project ID 465000527. To this respect, we would like to thank Thomas Geenen and Nils Wedi for their collaboration. We are also much grateful to Michael Lange and Balthasar Reuter from ECMWF, lead authors and maintainers of the CLOUDSC and CLOUDSC2 dwarfs, for their help with the compilation and execution of the Fortran-based implementations of the dwarfs.
