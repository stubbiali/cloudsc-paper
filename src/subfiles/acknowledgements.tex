	    This study was conducted as part of the Platform for Advanced Scientific Computing (PASC) funded project KILOS (``Kilometer-scale Non-hydrostatic global weather forecasting with IFS-FVM''), which also provided us with  computing resources on CSCS supercomputers. We  acknowledge access to the MeluXina supercomputer under the project ID 200177 and to the LUMI system under the project ID 465000527. We would like to thank the Destination Earth program, in particular Thomas Geenen and Nils Wedi, for the support. We are grateful to Michael Lange and Balthasar Reuter from ECMWF for their help regarding the reference dwarf implementations.
